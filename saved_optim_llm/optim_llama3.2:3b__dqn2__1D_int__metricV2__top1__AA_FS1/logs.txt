Your input fields are:
1. `context` (str): task description
2. `current_state` (str): current state represented as an array of lenght 9, starting from 0 to 8.
3. `available_actions` (str): list of empty cells avaiable to play

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `answer` (int): an integer describing next action given current state

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## context ## ]]
{context}

[[ ## current_state ## ]]
{current_state}

[[ ## available_actions ## ]]
{available_actions}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## answer ## ]]
{answer}        # note: the value you produce must be a single int value

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Given the fields `context`, `current_state`, `available_actions`, produce the fields `answer`.

["You are a bot playing a game of tic-tac-toe as a Cross (X). Your task is to play the next move and specify the grid cell index where you would place your turn. '0' indicates an empty cell, '1' indicates a cross, and '-1' indicates a circle."]

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Since all cells are empty except for one cell that is already occupied by an X, it's best to place my next move in the center of the grid. This gives me the most options for my next turn.

Given that there's already an X in position 5, it would be strategic to place my next move in one of the adjacent cells. Since cell 6 is empty, I will choose to place my next X in this cell.
