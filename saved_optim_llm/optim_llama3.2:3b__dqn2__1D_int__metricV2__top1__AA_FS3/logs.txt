Your input fields are:
1. `context` (str): task description
2. `current_state` (str): current state represented as an array of lenght 9, starting from 0 to 8.
3. `available_actions` (str): list of empty cells avaiable to play

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `answer` (int): an integer describing next action given current state

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## context ## ]]
{context}

[[ ## current_state ## ]]
{current_state}

[[ ## available_actions ## ]]
{available_actions}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## answer ## ]]
{answer}        # note: the value you produce must be a single int value

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Given the fields `context`, `current_state`, `available_actions`, produce the fields `answer`.

To maximize our chances of winning, we should place our cross in one of the four center cells that are not blocked by circles. Given the current state of the board, placing our cross in position 4 seems like a good strategy.

Since there is an empty cell at position 0, it's best to place my cross 'X' in that position to maintain flexibility for future moves.

Given that there are two circles in a row at positions 0, 2, and 5, it's best to block their potential win line by placing my cross 'X' in position 3.
