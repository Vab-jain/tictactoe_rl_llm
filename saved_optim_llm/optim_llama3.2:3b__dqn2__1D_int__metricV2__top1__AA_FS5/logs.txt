Your input fields are:
1. `context` (str): task description
2. `current_state` (str): current state represented as an array of lenght 9, starting from 0 to 8.
3. `available_actions` (str): list of empty cells avaiable to play

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `answer` (int): an integer describing next action given current state

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## context ## ]]

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Given the fields `context`, `current_state`, `available_actions`, produce the fields `answer`.

The available actions 0, 3, and 5 are being considered. Since the top-left corner is empty, it would likely be a good move to place the cross there. The middle column also has multiple options, but placing in the center would give more flexibility for the next turn. Placing in position 5 would also be a strong option as it blocks the opponent's potential three-in-a-row.

No available move to block Circle's potential win. Placing in center (4) ensures X's future winning opportunities.

Placing an 'X' in any of the empty cells would put more pressure on the opponent. Given the center is empty, it's a strategic choice to place 'X' there.

Since there are multiple empty cells available, I will choose one that seems like the best option to block the opponent's potential three-in-a-row. In this case, placing in cell 0 would be a strategic move.

The game has just started, and there are no moves to block or counter. The best initial move is to place 'X' in one of the empty cells to start gaining control of the board.
