Your input fields are:
1. `context` (str): task description
2. `current_state` (str): current state represented as an array of lenght 9, starting from 0 to 8.
3. `available_actions` (str): list of empty cells avaiable to play

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `answer` (int): an integer describing next action given current state

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## context ## ]]
{context}

[[ ## current_state ## ]]
{current_state}

[[ ## available_actions ## ]]
{available_actions}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## answer ## ]]
{answer}        # note: the value you produce must be a single int value

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Given the fields `context`, `current_state`, `available_actions`, produce the fields `answer`.

Since it's the start of the game, I'll place my Cross (X) in the center of the board, which is a common strategy in Tic-Tac-Toe.
